# data_cleaning_mexican_salaries_gov

In this jupyter notebook I transform and clean data from the dataset in csv file format
You can find the original file here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivansabik/mexican-federal-government-salaries
 to practice by yourself.

So the principal tasks that I did here are the follow:

Check the number of rows and columns
Check and drop the duplicated rows
Check and drop the null rows
Check the data types (and change them when apply).

In this particular dataset I decided to change the column order for a better order
beginnig with the Id then the name ('Nombre'), Cargo ('Position'), Area, and so on...

I decided to change some columns and rows to upper letters and rest lower case
Finally I export the new csv cleaned file.
